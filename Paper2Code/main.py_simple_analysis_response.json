Configuration Initialization:\n   \u2022 Load the configuration from \u201cconfig.yaml\u201d using a YAML parser.\n   \u2022 Extract and validate required settings \u2013 under the \u201ctraining\u201d section (learning_rate, batch_size, epochs as placeholders) and the \u201cevaluation\u201d section (n_way_sampling, evaluation_model).\n   \u2022 Log or print a message confirming that the configuration has been successfully loaded.\n\n2. Input Paper Handling:\n   \u2022 Accept the paper JSON input (either via a file path or direct input).\n   \u2022 Instantiate the PaperParser with the paper JSON.\n   \u2022 Call the parse() method on the PaperParser instance to convert the raw paper JSON into a structured Paper object.\n   \u2022 Check for any parsing errors and handle exceptions accordingly.\n\n3. Planning Stage Execution:\n   \u2022 With the structured Paper object, instantiate the Planner.\n   \u2022 Invoke Planner.create_overall_plan() to generate a high-level overall plan from the paper.\n   \u2022 Optionally, call Planner.generate_architecture_design() to obtain the detailed file list, UML diagrams (class diagram), and sequence diagram illustrating module dependencies.\n   \u2022 Generate or retrieve configuration details via Planner.generate_config() if needed.\n   \u2022 Combine these outputs into a comprehensive \u201cplan\u201d dictionary that will be passed to subsequent modules.\n\n4. Analysis Stage Execution:\n   \u2022 Instantiate the Analyzer by supplying the \u201cplan\u201d dictionary obtained from the planning stage.\n   \u2022 Call Analyzer.analyze_modules() to produce detailed file-level specifications.\n   \u2022 The returned analysis should include dependency ordering and specify input/output contracts for each module.\n   \u2022 Validate that the analysis covers all files listed in the plan.\n\n5. Code Generation Stage Execution:\n   \u2022 Instantiate the CodeGenerator with two inputs: the plan dictionary (which includes overall plan and architecture) and the analysis list from the Analyzer.\n   \u2022 Call CodeGenerator.generate_code() to create a dictionary of repository files (mapping file names to generated code content).\n   \u2022 Ensure that the code generation follows the dependency ordering provided by the Analyzer.\n   \u2022 Log the completion of this stage and check for any inconsistencies in the generated repository.\n\n6. Evaluation Stage Execution:\n   \u2022 Instantiate the Evaluator with the generated repository (the dictionary of files from the CodeGenerator).\n   \u2022 Call Evaluator.evaluate() to perform a model-based evaluation (using both reference-based and reference-free approaches) of the generated code.\n   \u2022 The Evaluator should internally use the evaluation parameters from the configuration (e.g., n_way_sampling and evaluation_model set to \u201co3-mini-high\u201d).\n   \u2022 Capture the evaluation metrics as a dictionary.\n\n7. Orchestration and Error Handling:\n   \u2022 Sequentially execute the stages in the following order: Paper Parsing \u2192 Planning \u2192 Analysis \u2192 Code Generation \u2192 Evaluation.\n   \u2022 Implement try/except blocks around each stage to catch and log errors, ensuring that any exception does not cause unhandled crashes.\n   \u2022 Log progress messages at each stage for debugging and tracing.\n   \u2022 After completing all stages, output the evaluation metrics to the console or save them in a report, indicating the overall reproducibility and correctness score.\n\n8. Summary of Data Flow and Dependencies:\n   \u2022 main.py acts as the central coordinator, importing and invoking:\n       \u2013 PaperParser (from paper_parser.py) to handle input paper conversion.\n       \u2013 Planner (from planner.py) to create the overall plan and design artifacts.\n       \u2013 Analyzer (from analyzer.py) to analyze and structure file-level specifications with dependency details.\n       \u2013 CodeGenerator (from code_generator.py) to generate modular code for each defined file.\n       \u2013 Evaluator (from evaluation.py) to assess the generated repository.\n   \u2022 All modules rely on shared configuration from config.yaml and use consistent data structures as specified in the \u201cData structures and interfaces\u201d design.\n   \u2022 The execution order (as also defined in the Program call flow diagram) is strictly maintained, ensuring that outputs from one stage serve as inputs for the following stage.\n\nBy following this organized control flow and using comprehensive error handling, main.py will effectively orchestrate the entire end-to-end reproduction pipeline, ensuring that the logic adheres strictly to the paper\u2019s methodology and the provided design specifications.\n[/CONTENT]", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745648470, "model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8810992130", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2326, "prompt_tokens": 21478, "total_tokens": 23804, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 1472, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}]
