# Paper2Code2Code

I ran the paper for Paper2Code through Paper2Code to get Paper2Code's code, aka, Paper2Code2Code.

I didn't rename the env variable "Transformer_repo" in the run script, so that's why the folder name looks out of place. I didn't rename it after the fact, as I wanted to preserve the exact run. This repo contains the entirety of the "output" folder.

Original repo: https://github.com/going-doer/Paper2Code
